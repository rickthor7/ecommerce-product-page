## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I ended up throwing away my initial code setup for the slider/lightbox functionality. I felt it was a bit much. My new version doesn't feel all that much different but I'm OK with it. There's quite a bit involved with this site where I think having a framework/library would benefit it. I would say my biggest hurdle was the slider/lightbox setup when you consider I'm not using a premade library for it.
